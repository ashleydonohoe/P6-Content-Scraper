// Scraping and Saving Data:
//     The scraper should get the price, title, url and image url from the product page and save this information into a CSV file.
//     The information should be stored in an CSV file that is named for the date it was created, e.g. 2016- 11-21.csv.
//     Assume that the the column headers in the CSV need to be in a certain order to be correctly entered into a database. They should be in this order: Title, Price, ImageURL, URL, and Time
// The CSV file should be saved inside the ‘data’ folder.
